//To grant permissions to the role, just showing what the role can see 
//For this case i just put to be visible the field CountryCode ES but i can put more SQL logic
// *IMPORTANT* Its not a filter, is a literal that will be used to restrict the data that the role can access.



//Example of access control is for roles that are used to restrict access to certain data based on specific criteria, such as country codes, user roles, or other attributes.
